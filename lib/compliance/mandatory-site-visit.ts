// walkthrough is extremely common in bid text and must never trigger this.
//
// This is one of the highest-stakes flags in the app: a proposal submitted
// without attending a truly mandatory walkthrough is typically rejected
// unopened as non-responsive, with no chance to fix it after the fact. But
// a false positive here (crying "mandatory" on an optional site visit)
// would train whoever reads it to stop trusting the flag, which defeats
// the point just as badly — precision matters as much as recall.
